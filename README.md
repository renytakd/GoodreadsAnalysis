## What can we get from "Goodreads" Indonesian Language Book Analysis data?

### Purpose
This analysis aims to find insight from the dataset regarding the list of Indonesian language books on the “goodreads” website.

This analysis is divided into 3 groups, which are

1. About the Books

which analyzes the books such as the top genres, trend lines over years, and top 10 books according to ratings, but with the condition that it must have a total rating of more than the average total rating, which is 2222.

2. About the Authors

This second one is an analysis of the authors, such as the authors with active book releases and the most rated authors based on rating and total number of ratings.

3. About the Publisher

The third one is to analyze the publisher. finding the most active and best publisher with the condition that the publisher had published more than two books (based on the average number of books published by the publisher) and had a total rating higher than the publisher's average rating, which is 5296.

4. About Everything Else

This last one is to analyze questions that can be answered based on data, namely, "Do most awarded books have the best rating?" and "Do pages affect the rating of books?"
